Hey!

Just want to say that my BOTC community are frequent users of your version of the townsquare, so, thanks!
I was wondering if you could potentially open up the ability to create issues & feature requests on the github repo so that users who may not have the knowledge to fix an issue or add a new featuer are able to suggest that.

Thank you for your hard work & development
